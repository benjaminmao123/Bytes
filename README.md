# Bytes

Bytes is a first person shooter where the player shoots fruit out of a cannon.

This game was made as part of a 10 week CS179 senior design project with 2 others.

We tried to accurately portray the SDLC and follow Agile by implementing Scrum. 

Our results can be seen in our burndown chart linked below:
